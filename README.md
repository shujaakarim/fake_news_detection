🌐 Fake News Detection Website
The Fake News Detection Website is a Flask-based web application built with Python 🐍 to help users identify whether the news they come across is real or fake. It uses a machine learning model to analyze news articles or headlines and predict their authenticity. With a user-friendly interface 🖥️ and interactive design, this application provides an easy way to check news credibility in just a few clicks! Here's how it works:

🔧 Technologies Used:
Python: The main programming language for the back-end.

Flask: A lightweight micro-framework that powers the app's server and handles the logic behind predictions.

HTML/CSS: Used to structure and style the front-end, creating an attractive and functional user interface.

Bootstrap: For responsive and mobile-friendly design, ensuring the app looks great on all devices 📱.

Machine Learning: The heart of the app—using a trained model to predict fake news based on user input.

🌟 Key Features:
Input News: Users can easily input news headlines or full articles into a text box 📰.

Prediction: Once the user submits their content, the app analyzes it and predicts if the news is real or fake 🤖.
